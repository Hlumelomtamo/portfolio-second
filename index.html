            <p>Wine Tasting RSA is a mobile-first app that helps users discover and book wine tasting experiences across South Africa. The app allows users to browse curated wineries, view detailed information about each estate (location, description, images, and experiences), and request or book tastings directly through the platform.
                Designed for both locals and tourists, the app focuses on popular wine regions like Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, making it easy to explore top estates such as Lanzerac Wine Estate and Boschendal.
                The goal of the app is to simplify wine tourism in South Africa by combining winery discovery, booking, and location-based browsing into one easy-to-use digital platform</p>
